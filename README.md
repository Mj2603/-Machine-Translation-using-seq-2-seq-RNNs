# Machine-Translation-using-seq-2-seq-RNNs

# Introduction
In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.


## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
- Keras 2.x
